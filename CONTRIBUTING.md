## Getting Started

Before contributing, please ensure you have:

1. **Forked the repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Cloned your fork** to your local machine
3. **Set up the development environment** (see [Development Setup](#development-setup))
4. **Created a feature branch** for your changes

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Java 11** or later
- **Gradle 9.1.0** or later
- **Android Studio**
- **Git**

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sketch.git
   cd Sketch
   ```

2. **Add the upstream remote:**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/EranBoudjnah/sketch.git
   ```

### Project Modules

The project consists of two main modules:

- **`app/`** - Example project
- **`sketch/`** - Library code

## Project Structure

```
├── app/                    # Command-line interface
├── sketch/                 # Core business logic and templates
├── automation/             # Build and development automation
├── gradle/                 # Gradle configuration
├── build.gradle.kts        # Root build configuration
└── .github/README.md       # Project documentation
```

## Code Style and Standards

### Kotlin Coding Standards

- **Function and class size matters** - Keep functions and classes focused and concise
- **No abbreviations or acronyms** - Use full words (e.g., "directory" not "dir", "arguments" not "args")
- **No comments except in tests** - Code should be self-documenting
- **Test comments should mark sections** - Use "Given", "When", "Then" comments in tests

### Code Quality Tools

The project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

- **ktlint** - Kotlin code style enforcement
- **Pre-commit hooks** - Automatic code quality checks before commits

### Running Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Format code with ktlint
./gradlew ktlintFormat

# Check code style
./gradlew ktlintCheck

# Run all checks
./gradlew check
```

## Testing

### Test Requirements

- **Write tests for new functionality** - Testing Compose can be challenging. Test what makes sense
- **Update existing tests** - When changing behavior, update or add tests accordingly
- **Test coverage** - Aim for comprehensive test coverage of new code

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
./gradlew test

# Run tests for a specific module
./gradlew :app:test
./gradlew :sketch:test
```

### Test Structure

Tests should follow the Given-When-Then pattern:

```kotlin
@Test
fun `Given valid input provided when generate then generates use case`() {
    // Given
    val useCaseName = "GetUserData"
    val inputType = "UserId"
    val outputType = "User"
    val expectedName = "GetUserDataUseCase"

    // When
    val actual = useCaseGenerator.generate(useCaseName, inputType, outputType)

    // Then
    assertNotNull(actual)
    assertThat(actual.name).isEqualTo(expectedName)
}
```

## Submitting Changes

### Before Submitting

1. **Ensure all tests pass:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```

2. **Run code quality checks:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew ktlintCheck
   ```

3. **Consider updating README** if your changes add new features or change behavior

### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Push your changes** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-feature-branch
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
    - **Clear title** describing the change
    - **Detailed description** of what was changed and why
    - **Reference to any related issues**
    - **Screenshots** for UI changes (if applicable)

3. **PR Title Format:**
   ```
   Type: Brief description of change

   Examples:
   - Feature: Add support for custom use case templates
   - Fix: Resolve issue with data source generation
   - Refactor: Improve code generation performance
   - Docs: Update CLI help documentation
   ```

### Commit Message Guidelines

Follow conventional commit format:

```
Type(scope): description

Examples:
- feat(cli): added new --template option for custom generation
- fix(core): resolved issue with package name validation
- refactor(plugin): improved dialog validation logic
- test(core): added tests for use case generator
```
